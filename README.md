## Installation

Despite being a Theme in practical terms, *Modern WordPress Website* is installed as a mu-plugin. This way we intercept WordPress requests at an earlier stage and have more control over it.

To get started, simply follow these steps in a clean WordPress installation:

- Create wp-content/**mu-plugins** folder.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Luc45/ModernWordPressWebsite .` inside **mu-plugins** folder.
- Run `composer update` inside the recently created **mww** folder to generate the autoload files.
- (Recommended) You will not need your theme anymore, you can create an empty theme with just index.php, style.css and functions.php. [Download empty theme](https://github.com/Luc45/EmptyTheme/archive/master.zip).

Now it's up to you to create awesome stuff!
