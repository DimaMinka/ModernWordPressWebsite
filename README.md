## Installation

Despite being a Theme in practical terms, *Modern WordPress Theme* is installed as a mu-plugin. This way we intercept WordPress requests at an earlier stage and have more control over it.

To get started, simply follow these steps:

- Create and navigate to wp-content/**mu-plugins** folder
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Luc45/ModernWordPressWebsite .`
- Inside the **mww** folder, run `composer update` to generate the autoload files.

Now it's up to you to create awesome stuff!
