/**
 * To get started with tests, I recommend wp-browser.
 * WP-Browser is a set of extensions for Codeception, which in turn, is a wrapper around PHP Unit.
 * In my opinion, it's the most complete test suite for WordPress to this date.
 *
 * Run this in the mu-plugins/mww folder:
 * composer require --dev lucatume/wp-browser
 *
 * Read installation instructions here:
 * https://github.com/lucatume/wp-browser
